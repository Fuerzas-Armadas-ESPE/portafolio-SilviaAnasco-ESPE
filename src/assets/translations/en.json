My interest for the development started when i was in high school: My former school, even if it has something call 'Bachillerato Unificado' where we supose to not specialize in any field of study (like before), it provied some 'auxiliaruras' such as gastronomy, turism and programming; I choose the last one, of course, and since then I got the desire to learn more about it. Now, I'm studying Software Engineering at 'Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas - ESPE'.",
